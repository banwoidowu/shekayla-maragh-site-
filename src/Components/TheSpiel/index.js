          <h2> The Spiel </h2>
          I'm Shekayla Maragh, muh - raaj, (you would be surprise at the many laughable pronunciations of folks attempting to say this.. I do love a trier though).
          <br/><br/>
          I am a freelance Creative Producer and Project Manager, working across art-form with a specialism in live music touring, festivals and events. I'm also the founder and director of CUBE, a talent and development agency, designed to serve and support music creatives in the Midlands. A key theme in my practice is to create accessible work for those who are under-represented and misrepresented in arts and culture.
          <br/><br/>
          I have worked nationally and internationally on interdisciplinary cultural projects and produced and delivered for a range of arts organisations and commercial brands such as Punch, Beatfreeks, Birmingham Hippodrome and Selfridges. Some of my projects include Producer for B-Side Hip Hop Festival, Live and Loud festival, Diaspora Britain and have worked on a range of large-scale outdoor events such as Glastonbury, Birmingham Weekender and Birmingham's Commonwealth Games handover. I also sometimes get asked to speak on panels and to guest lecture at universities.
          <br/><br/>
          No one really has time to read large volumes of text these days, I once read that a humans attention span is now less than that of a gold fish. If you're still reading and what to find out more about my work, drop me an email. I'm always open to listening.
