          CUBE was formed from a need to support and develop the artistic interests and ambitions of music creatives, particularly those located in the Midlands.
          <br/><br/>
          Being conscious of the talent I get to work with daily is an ever green inspiration, however, over time you identify the challenges and frustrations that come with not having conventional access to core spaces and resources that supports and elevates a music creatives' work and  to make a sustaining career when one lives outside of the music powerhouse that is London.
          <br/><br/>
          CUBE is an enabler and activates opportunties that provide meaningful support in authentic spaces for those same creators, makers and disrupters that I have the privilege to encounter along my own journey.
          <br/><br/>
          More from CUBE soon, stay locked.
