            <p>Hiya, I’m Shekayla,
              <br/><br/>
              A Creative Producer and Project Manager. I work cross art-form with a heart for creative development and a specialism in live music touring and festival and event production. I'm also the founder and director of CUBE, a talent and development agency, formed to serve and support music creatives in the Midlands.
              <br/><br/>
              I have worked nationally and internationally on interdisciplinary cultural projects and produced and delivered for a range of arts organisations and brands.  I love working with bright teams and confident to work solo when duty calls. I'm drawn to the earliest stage of concept development and love being part of a build. I've led teams, managed stakeholder relationships and budgets, curated programmes and have a sharp eye for production and logistics - feel free to have a gander at my projects below.  From time to time I’m asked to speak on panels and to guest lecture at universities such as Sørveiv music conference and Birmingham City University.
              <br/><br/>
              No one has time to read large volumes of text these days, I once read that humans attention span is now less than that of a goldfish. If you're still reading and what to find out more about me or would like to connect, drop me a line. I'm always open to listening.
